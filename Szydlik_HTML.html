<hr class="intro">
<br>
Early fall in 2022, a President makes a commitment. 1.5 billion dollars awarded to states and territories in the U.S. Over one hundred million dollars invested in rural communities' treatment options. Widespread access to overdose reversal medication and millions more invested into national recovery support.
<br>
<br>
President Biden was making good on a promise he made in his first State of the Union <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/07/fact-sheet-in-state-of-the-union-president-biden-to-outline-vision-to-advance-progress-on-unity-agenda-in-year-ahead/#:~:text=During%20his%20first%20State%20of,veterans%3B%20tackling%20the%20mental%20health">address</a> to help curb the opioid crisis ravaging the nation.
<br>
<br>
There’s no denying the need for improved treatment, with nearly 100 thousand overdose <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/databriefs/pdf/SUDORS_Data-Brief_Number_1.pdf">deaths</a> in 2020, which was a 30% increase from the previous year, as well as a steady increase in the following years.
<br>
<br>
Doctors and government leaders alike recognize the United States opioid crisis but, recent data from the Centers for Disease Control’s State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/fatal/sudors.html">(SUDORS)</a> suggests that it’s more than that. It’s shifting into a new phase as a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stopoverdose/polysubstance-use/index.html#:">polysubstance use crisis.</a>
</hr>
<br>
<br>

<strong><strong><h2 class="sudors">What is the SUDORS database?</h2></strong></strong>

<p class="paragraph_one">According to the CDC, SUDORS obtains overdose data from 48 jurisdictions in the U.S. through death certificates and medical examiner and coroner reports. Upon entry into the platform, the data is shared with the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) in each jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>
By creating SUDORS, the CDC seeks to improve information surrounding overdose information in the U.S. to improve the country’s treatment and recovery options by making them information-based.
<br>
<br>
Predominantly, SUDORS' <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/fatal/sudors.html">goals</a>  are to, “Better understand the circumstances that surround overdose deaths, improve overdose data and timeliness and accuracy and identify specific substances causing or contributing to the death as well as emerging and polysubstance overdose trends to help inform overdose prevention and response efforts.” </p>
<br>
<br>

<p class="paragraph_two">
<strong><h2 class="battlefield">A new battlefield</h2></strong>
The past five years have brought a rise in illicit synthetic opioids to the market, namely fentanyl. The illicit drug, which is up to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871622001351?via%3Dihub">50 times</a> more potent than heroin, is easy and inexpensive to produce.

“One pill can now take your life. Fentanyl is the nuclear weapon of drugs and we’ve got to up our game against this scourge,” Washington Gov. Jay Inslee <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/pacific-northwest-fentanyl-crisis-surges-officials-grapple-curb-105637178">said</a> in a statement to ABC News.

<br>
<br>

On Dec. 14, The LA Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-12-14/fentanyl-has-become-los-angeles-countys-most-deadly-drug">reported </a> that fentanyl is now the leading cause of overdose in Los Angeles County, surpassing methamphetamine and other classes of opioids.
<br>
<br>

Prescription opioids like Oxycontin are no longer the driving force behind America’s opioid crisis.

<strong><h2 class="stimulant">The stimulant effect</h2></strong>
Between 2020 and 2021, according to the SUDORS dataset, overdose deaths caused by a polysubstance combination — in this case, an opioid and a stimulant — increased by nearly 30%. In comparison, overdose deaths caused by the presence of an opioid alone increased by 0.9%.
<br>
<br>
Opinions surrounding the causes of this immense increase vary. On the one hand, there’s the biological response, officials say. Overdose reversal medications like naloxone, known by its brand name Narcan, only work on opioid receptors.
<br>
<br>
Where individuals struggling with opioid use disorder have access to FDA-approved medication-assisted treatment, an individual struggling with stimulant addiction, like methamphetamine, cocaine, or a prescription, does not, and it makes recovery more complicated.
<br>
<br>
“Stopping prolonged stimulant use is extremely difficult without medical help,” Dr. Ayana Jordan, an NYU addiction specialist <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/are-no-treatments-cocaine-meth-addiction-rcna120809" >said</a> to NBC. “There’s nothing that I have seen on the horizon or even clinical trials that are promising.”

<strong><h2 class="supermeth">A “supermeth” threat</h2></strong>
Between the Biden administration's investment into improved opioid treatment and trafficking intervention as well as civil settlements from pharmaceutical companies making national <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/health/purdue-sacklers-opioids-settlement.html">headlines</a>, steps being taken to combat the opioid crisis are far ahead of efforts to combat polysubstance crises.
<br>
<br>
In a 12-month period that ended in May 2023, provisional federal <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm">data</a> attributed over 34 thousand deaths to methamphetamine and 28 thousand to cocaine.
<br>
<br>
Methamphetamine started as a plant-based drug, like opioids. But now, it can be mass-produced synthetically and formulated to be more potent than ever before. Some <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/the-new-meth/620174/">researchers </a>say they cannot “even call it meth anymore,” only making treatment more complex.
<br>
<br>
Methamphetamine erupts pleasure receptors in the human brain and spikes dopamine levels, altering brain chemistry down to the neurotransmitter level.
<br>
<br>
<br>

According to the SUDORS dataset, overdose deaths caused by methamphetamine increased by 8 thousand, and deaths caused by cocaine increased by over 5 thousand. Experts say these numbers will likely only continue to climb in datasets from the past few years and moving forward.
<br>
<br>
At the community level, Dr. Brian Johnson, a professor emeritus of psychiatry and the former director of Addiction Medicine at Upstate Medical University, said the first stage in modernizing treatment and recovery is acknowledgment.
<br>
<br>
“I would say from my perspective as a neuro psychoanalyst is that there’s mass denial. And I often start by asking people how many people they think die from drug addiction per year,” Dr. Johnson said. “The last time I calculated it it was 22% of Americans and that number is probably only higher now. People need help and treatment.”
